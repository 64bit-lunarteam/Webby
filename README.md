# Webby ======
Webby is a discord webhook controller created by certifiedfish101. If you can find the link to a webhook, you can have full control over what it says or does... easy!
This version, Webby Clean Edition, is a project I made that cleans up the code of Webby, tweaks the UI, and fixes bugs. It is the definitive version of webby as of now, and is made by Venom.
